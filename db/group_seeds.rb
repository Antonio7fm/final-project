    "name": "*Explore The Bay (ETB)",
    "description": "<p>We are a social group of singles and couples, including all ages of adults who enjoy exploring the wonderful Bay Area of Northern California. In fact, according to the Meetup.com algorithm, we are the most active \"Social\" group in the Bay Area. You are welcome to join us as we explore cool bars, night clubs, restaurants, museums, vineyards, hiking adventures, house parties, etc. We will also sprinkle in some community volunteer opportunities. We will <b>LEVERAGE</b> our group to receive discounts, extended happy hours, and other great perks that an individual cannot get. </p>
    <p>***In order to join, you need to be recognizable in your photo. Having an action shot, group photo, or any photo where it\'s not clear who you are won\'t work as we take attendance at our events.</p>
    <p>Our members range in age from 21 to 80+. We don\'t discriminate. If you are looking to just hang out with people your own age in trying to hook up, then this isn\'t the right group for you as this is a very diverse group with a lot of positive energy. Join and you will meet some quality, new friends. <br></p>
    <p>This group is about helping out in the community, having fun, exploring the Bay Area, and meeting new friends while in a safe environment. By joining this group or remaining a member of this group, you agree to refrain from the list of inappropriate behaviors listed  below while attending Explore the Bay events or visiting the Explore the Bay Meetup site. If you exhibit any of the following, you will be removed from the group:</p>
    <p><strong>Inappropriate Behavior</strong> </p>
    <p>• Sending spam emails to members to promote a business, event, etc. without permission of the main organizer. <br></p>
    <p>• Posting comments on an event page or using the \"Start a conversation...\" functionality to promote a business, event, etc. without permission of the main organizer. <br></p>
    <p>• Not having a picture where you are recognizable. If you aren\'t recognizable in your ETB profile picture, then you are subject to removal and will have to request to rejoin the group with a valid photo. <br></p>
    <p>• Sending emails to members you haven\'t met for the purposes of dating or picking up. This isn\'t a dating website.</p>
    <p>• Having multiple profiles with the group. Only one profile is permitted per person.</p>
    <p>• Excessive posting of comments or negative comments on event wall-space. This requires the Event Host to volunteer additional time and also causes members to waste time looking for important event updates. Note that there is no need to tell us that you won\'t be attending an event. Merely change you your registration status. <br></p>
    <p>• Texting or calling the Organizer for any reason other than trying to find the group during a meetup event. Note that the number is provided to facilitate finding the group only. No exceptions. <br></p>
    <p>• Being touchy or physical with another member (overly aggressive). </p>
    <p>• Causing another member to feel uncomfortable based upon behavior OR comments (creepiness).</p>
    <p>• Showing inappropriate pictures or content to other members at an event.</p>
    <p>• Excessive gossiping about fellow members and/or creating too much drama. </p>
    <p>• Behaving in a manner that suggests a sense of entitlement such as requesting organizers to volunteer too much of their valuable time.</p>
    <p>• Excessive no shows in relation to the number of events attended. Note that we take attendance at most events except music in the park events. Members are responsible to monitor their own registration status. When you are on a waiting list, don\'t assume that you didn\'t get in to an event. <br></p>
    <p>• Repeatedly bailing out of events right before they start. A high frequency of this behavior can lead to be removed from the group. <br></p>
    <p>• Stalking other members.</p>
    <p>• Blocking the main organizer from contacting you. <br></p>
    <p>• Showing up to an event without securing a spot (crashing). Note that members are not allowed to bring a guest to an event unless they secure a spot online for their guest. </p>
    <p>• The same thing holds true for couples who use one profile. Make sure you secure two spots initially if both of you are attending an event. Note that if an event becomes full, you cannot add guests without losing your \"attending\" spot and being moved to the \"waiting list\". Note that for some events with limited spots we don\'t allow any guests to register as we want to provide value to as many members as possible.</p>
    <p><strong> <br></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Expected Member Conduct</strong></p>
    <p>Members are expected to read the event description and any updates posted by the Event Organizer before attending an event. This helps eliminate the need to ask questions that have already been explicitly stated in the event description. It also keeps expectations in alignment with the event format/structure.</p>
    <p>Please use a personal photo where you are recognizable for your profile as we like to know whom we are communicating with and we take attendance at our events. Otherwise you will not be admitted to the group or you might be removed from the group.</p>
    <p>In order to receive important emails sent from Event Organizers, make sure that you have the following setting options enabled for this group: ‘Announcement about a specific Meetup’ and ‘Announcement to members about the group’. </p>
    <p>Note that we sometimes remove inactive members from the group. We encourage active membership. </p>
    <p><strong> <br></strong></p>

    <p>Organized by a handful of volunteers with the help of some faithful sponsors and your generous donations, we host: <br></p>
    <p>2 monthly meetups</p>
    <p>- Presentation Night on the 2nd Wednesday of each month features intermediate to advanced level tech talks from Python Software Foundation members, core developers of open-source projects, and local software engineers.  </p>
    <p>- Project Night on the 3rd Wednesday of most months offers a chill evening to hack on projects, get questions answered, mentor other devs, or attend a tutorial.  It\'s usually held at various companies in SF so you get to sample how different companies are using Python.</p>
    <p>PyBay, a yearly regional Python Conference</p>
    <p>PyBay is the local version of PyCon.  You can save on travel costs and still have an experience of the conference that serious python developers aspire to attend.  PyBay is a 3-day weekend conference in August featuring 40 talks and 400+ attendees.</p>
    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMUUiioi5g</p>
    <p>An annual holiday party</p>
    <p>We think you\'d agree that if you have been coming to SF Python\'s events, you have been advancing in your field.  So come celebrate the year with us.  We will listen to more amazing speakers while enjoying great food and drinks.  Who knows, if we continue to get lucky, we will have more amazing entertainers to help us celebrate the year.</p>
    <p><b>Why do we put these events up?</b></p>
    <p>We believe there is power in in-person interactions.  We believe in learning, sharing, and helping each other out.  And we have seen the results.  We have heard stories of people getting their problems solved because of the talks and the people they met at our events.  We have witnessed people grow in their career, from receiving their first internship to landing their first speaking gig at conferences.  We have even heard companies migrating to a different platform/technologies after attending our conference.  </p>
    <p>We look forward to your joining this awesome community - be it attending our events, giving a talk, being a sponsor or supporting us financially!</p>",

We have meetings in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, and elsewhere in Silicon Valley; if you live in SF you may want to join our sister group: the San Francisco Ethereum Developer Meetup. <br></p>
    <p>For more information on Ethereum see the whitepaper, the yellowpaper, forums on Stackexchange and Reddit, and also Gitter Chat.  <br></p>
    <p>We welcome proposals for talks at svethereummeetup@gmail.com. <span>Here are a few things that we look at when evaluating projects that want to talk to us: (1) </span><span>Does your website, whitepaper, pitch look professional? (2) </span><span>How mature of an understanding of Ethereum and decentralization is shown? (3) </span><span>Is the business model something new, interesting, decentralized, and useful?  (4) Are you willing to educate us (including the flaws and tradeoffs in your products), or are you solely interested in marketing</span><span>? We are very cautious about presentations from any group with a live token sale, or who are within two months of such a sale. </span></p>
    <p><span>Our focus is on the good and bad of Ethereum; we prefer to leave the faults of other cryptocurrencies and organizations (the US dollar, Federal Reserve) to other venues wherever possible.  </span><span>The Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup is dedicated to an enjoyable experience for all; see details </span>here.  <span>Contact us at svethereummeetup@gmail.com if you\'d like to help organize events. </span></p>

    <p>West Coast Soccer is not affiliated with a club or any other organization, we are soccer enthusiasts on the search of the next great game, <b>if you want to hold an event or host a game(s) please contact us!</b></p>
    <p>No commitment is involved, the cost/contribution is always between 0- $20 per event - fees go towards equipment purchases/maintenance, organizer traveling expenses, Meetup dues, permits etc. </p>
    <p>Game time is at least 1 hour but might be more or less depending on venue/day/time, every session is supervised by an organizer and includes game balls, cones, goals, scrimmage vests for every player, and lots of playing time. </p>
    <p>It\'s easy to join our soccer community and meet other footballers, just come by yourself or with friends, we form teams randomly as players show up. </p>
    <p>Join our Meetup group for free, it keeps you informed about upcoming sessions, allows you to communicate with other players and RSVP for games. After you registered you will automatically receive game invitations via email.</p>
    <p>To play in any of our games RSVP for the game(s) you want to play in and show up 15 min early for a guaranteed spot, after that it becomes first come first serve! </p>
    <p>The game setup varies on different days, but we mostly play 7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, sometimes we rotate teams and allow subs depending on numbers. Most venues we utilize have an artificial turf surface, we recommend cleats, flats, or turf shoes, shin guards are not mandatory but recommended. Some games are with referees but most games are not.</p>
    <p>Each game needs a min. of 12 RSVP\'S in order to be viable or 8 players need to be present to play after 10min of the scheduled time. If a game is not viable after 10min of the scheduled time it will be canceled and everyone receives a full refund.</p>

    <p><span>*** Enjoy Life in One of the World\'s Most Diverse, Cultural  & Quality </span>Cities !<span> *** </span> <br></p>
    <p>GLOBAL FRIENDS -- There are no strangers here, just FRIENDS YOU HAVEN\'T MET ! </p>
    <p>--- Message from Organizer: *We have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, racism, sexism, ageism, etc. - any insults towards members will result in ejection from the event. This group is meant to reflect the diversity of San Francisco, and to combine the many cultures within.  <br> <br>Check your ego at the door, meet some new people at one of our events, and expand your professional and personal network in San Francisco. Most of all - have fun! ---- Paul</p>
    <p>* A community is great because of its members, and we need you to make it great! </p>
    <p><i>If you enjoy friendship, activities, music, arts,</i></p>
    <p><i>networking, socializing, parties,</i></p>
    <p><i>learning, sharing, inspiration, personal/professional development,</i></p>
    <p><i>travel, culture, language, and/or some fun, </i></p>
    <p><i>and you like them for free,</i></p>
    <p><i>this is the group for you!!</i> </p>
    <p>Let\'s explore together  & see what the city\'s got to offer! </p>
    <p>We live in an ever-shrinking world, where the technologies and transportation systems make it easier than ever to connect people from every corner of the world. We also have the fortune to live in a quality and vibrant city that is home to people of diverse backgrounds and life experience. The <i>San Francisco Friends Network</i> gives you an opportunity to experience some of the many international cultures that San Francisco hosts, to share your knowledge of cultural heritage, interests/hobbies or professional expertise with other members of the group, and make new friends while doing so.</p>
    <p>A mission for this group is to provide good company as well as a positive and safe environment for members to experience things that, for whatever reasons, you longed for but weren\'t able to do before. You\'ll also get to know things that you can do and enjoy in San Francisco through the meetups proposed by your peers. It is also a hope of our group to promote cross-cultural dialogues, sharing, understanding, and peer supports through a variety of local activities and events, as well as international trips.</p>
    <p>But we (organizers) are few and you are many, and this means that to work toward these goals we need the proactive participation and supports from at least some members of the community. This group is unique because of our members, and we look forward to meeting you and facilitate the meetup ideas you propose.</p>
    <p>* We are a hundred thousand (100,000) global citizens that meet locally  & connect globally.</p>
    <p>===========================</p>
    <p>THE GLOBAL FRIENDSHIP NETWORK </p>
    <p>===========================</p>
    <p>A network where you get to meet new friends in every major city worldwide, a place people share their precious experience, perspectives, and cultures from every corner of the world! </p>
    <p>If you happen to be traveling to the following cities or even thinking of the possibilities of staying somewhere overseas for a while (long or short), welcome to join the respective groups and connect to members there. We\'ll be happy to facilitate a welcoming/social meetup for you while you arrive (FREE of charge:), or contact our connections there for you in case you need assistance. </p>
    <p>Our membership will ALWAYS be FREE for all groups in the network, as well as events and service from organizers. </p>
    <p><i>* We are NOT associated/affiliated with any travel agencies, immigration companies, or other for-profit organizations etc. Just a service with good intentions  & best efforts:)</i></p>
    <p><i>* More cities coming--Montreal, Vancouver, Rome, Berlin, Dubai, Thailand...</i></p>
    <p>THE SAN FRANCISCO FRIENDS NETWORK</p>
    <p>This is a platform in San Francisco where people get to discover the city together in a fun and safe environment. People who are familiar with the city are of course welcome to join us and even provide meeting ideas. Newcomers to San Francisco  (from overseas) are also more than welcome to join us and explore San Francisco and California together!</p>
    <p><i>*** Enjoy Life, Dream BIG  & Live with Passion ! ***</i> </p>
    <p>We aim at building a safe and friendly community with people currently residing in San Francisco or visiting from overseas. You don\'t need to have experience overseas or be able to speak English to join this group. Every friendly person is welcome in this group! (Including people local in San Francisco or (originally) from other parts of the world.) </p>
    <p>Dear friends,</p>
    <p>This is an effort to establish a global network of communities, currently being fast deployed in major cities worldwide, including but not limited to,<i> Paris, London, Rome, Berlin,</i> <i>New York,</i> <i>San Francisco</i> <i>(Silicon Valley)</i><i>, LA, Chicago, Washington DC, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai,</i> <i>Beijing, Thailand</i>... And much more!</p>
    <p>Our mandate is to build a global platform that belongs to all members in it. Participants get to mix and mingle in a safe and friendly environment, have fun and adventures together, or establish long-lasting friendship among local/global members. </p>
    <p>We will facilitate members to participate in various activities, festivals, and social mixers for free, plus opportunities for the adventurous to explore hidden gems in the city together--enjoying a rich and happy lifestyle to the fullest! Newcomers and international visitors will benefit from the hospitality of local residents, and get to blend in a new environment smoothly with flying colors...</p>
    <p>We believe that this service can be offered for FREE, and we need your participation and encouragement to make it happen!</p>
    <p>• We have reached our first milestone of 100,000 members in 20 cities within a couple years, becoming one of the largest global communities in the world, ever!</p>
    <p>• NEXT MILESTONE: 100 cities, 1 million friends -- <i>Establish a global network of friendship, Spread happiness  & joy to every corner of the world, Promote harmony  & peer assistance in communities locally and Magnify synergy of societies globally.</i></p>
    <p>If you are fond of our vision, do not hesitate to join us and check it out! Invite your family and friends who may be interested or benefit from this platform. When you see fit, share our events on your personal social media or extend our invitation to communities you are affiliated with.</p>
    <p>We appreciate your supports, volunteering, and valuable inputs, while nothing is mandatory except for mutual respects to all members in the community:)</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>

    "name": "The Bay Area Multifamily Real Estate Investing Meetup (BAMF)",
    "description": "<p>We are a dynamic and fast growing Meetup group designed to build relationships and invest in Multi-Family projects together, and create massive cash flow, and wealth. We hold free monthly meetings in <b>San Francisco, San Mateo, Fremont</b> and <b>San Jose</b>, and <b>Online </b>(through webinars), so everyone is welcome to join.</p>
    <p><b>WE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC: </b>In case you haven\'t noticed, the Multi-Family industry is benefiting from a once in a lifetime investor opportunity - The Millennial generation are less interested in buying homes than any previous generation, raising demand, stability and profit for Multifamily investors.</p>
    <p><b>WE PROVIDE EDUCATION: </b>Our Meetup piggybacks on this mega-trend, and provides Multi-family education, networking and deal exposure to encourage investment in Multi-family properties in many states. <span>Whether you plan on setting up and running your own Multi-Family projects or want to invest passively in someone else\'s deal, this Meetup is the place to be.</span></p>
    <p><b>WE PROVIDE ACCESS: </b><span>If you are lucky enough an accredited investor as defined by the SEC, you probably have access to some of these Multifamily projects. If you don\'t meet those qualifications, you can gain access to these awesome investment opportunities by getting educated and forging a relationship with deal organizers.</span></p>
    <p><span>These are institutional type investments accessible only by grouping investment funds (unless you have very deep pockets). Multi-family is the investment of choice these days for all manner of institutional investors. Why? Because they are one of the most reliable and high-yielding investments out there.  <br></span></p>
    <p><b>THE RETURNS ARE EXCELLENT: </b>Multifamily investments returns typically outperform stock markets and single family investments. If you are still investing in CDs, Bonds or similar investments, take a look at the graphic below to see what an amazing difference higher return opportunities make to your quest for financial freedom.</p>
    <p><b>WE KNOW A SECRET</b>: Don\'t tell anyone, but Multi-family investments create wealth almost magically. Unlike single family homes, Multi-family properties are primarily valued based on Net Operating Income. Even a tiny increase in Net Operating Income can create an enormous increase in net worth for the investors. Take a look at the typical example below. This isn\'t pie-in-the-sky math, it happens in Multi-family investing extremely regularly. <br></p>
    <p><b>WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE: </b><span>It takes both training and experience to make it all come together and work. </span><span>With decades of collective experience, our organizer team has extensively training in multi-family and can guide you. Whether you are looking for great passive investments, support in buying your own property, or assistance putting your own projects together, we have the resources available within this group. </span> <br></p>
    <p>We look forward to having you join us in this exciting, dynamic, profitable group!  </p>

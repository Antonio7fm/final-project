  "description": "<p>We are a social group of singles and couples, including all ages of adults who enjoy exploring the wonderful Bay Area of Northern California. In fact, according to the Meetup.com algorithm, we are the most active Social group in the Bay Area. You are welcome to join us as we explore cool bars, night clubs, restaurants, museums, vineyards, hiking adventures, house parties, etc. We will also sprinkle in some community volunteer opportunities. We will&nbsp;<b>LEVERAGE</b> our group to receive discounts, extended happy hours, and other great perks that an individual cannot get. </p> <
      p > ** * In order to join,
  you need to be recognizable in your photo.Having an action shot,
  group photo,
  or any photo & nbsp;where & nbsp;it 's not clear who you are&nbsp;won'
  t work as we take attendance at our events. < /p> <
  p > Our members range in age from 21 to 80 + .We don 't discriminate. If you are looking to just hang out with people your own age in trying to hook up, then this isn'
  t the right group
  for you as this is a very diverse group with a lot of positive energy.Join and you will meet some quality,
  new friends. < br > < /p> <
  p > This group is about helping out in the community,
  having fun,
  exploring the Bay Area,
  and meeting new friends
  while in a safe environment.By joining this group or & nbsp;remaining a member of this group,
  you agree to & nbsp;refrain from the & nbsp;list of inappropriate & nbsp;behaviors listed & nbsp;below
  while attending & nbsp;Explore the Bay & nbsp;events or & nbsp;visiting the Explore the Bay Meetup site.If you exhibit any of the following,
  you will be removed from the group: < /p> <
      p > < strong > Inappropriate Behavior < /strong> </p >
      <
      p > • & nbsp;Sending spam emails to members to promote a business,
  event,
  etc.without permission of the main organizer. < br > < /p> <
  p > •Posting comments on an event page or using the Start a conversation...functionality to promote a business,
  event,
  etc.without permission of the main organizer. < br > < /p> <
  p > •Not having a picture where you are recognizable.If you aren 't recognizable in your ETB profile picture, then you are subject to removal and will have to request to rejoin the group with a valid photo. <br></p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Sending emails to members & nbsp;you haven 't met for the purposes of dating or picking up. This isn'
  t a dating website. < /p> <
  p > •Having multiple profiles with the group.Only one profile is permitted per person. < /p> <
  p > •Excessive posting of comments or negative comments on event wall - space.This requires the Event Host to volunteer additional time and also causes members to waste time looking
  for important event updates.Note that there is no need to tell us that you won 't be attending an event. Merely change you your registration status. <br></p> <
  p > •Texting or calling the Organizer
  for any reason other than trying to find the group during a meetup event.Note that the number is provided to facilitate finding the group only.No exceptions. < br > < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Being & nbsp;touchy or physical with & nbsp;another member(overly aggressive). < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Causing & nbsp;another member & nbsp;to feel uncomfortable based upon behavior OR comments(creepiness). < /p> <
  p > •Showing & nbsp;inappropriate pictures or & nbsp;content & nbsp;to other members at an event. < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Excessive gossiping about fellow members and / or creating too much drama. < /p> <
  p > •Behaving in a manner that suggests a sense of entitlement such as requesting organizers to volunteer too much of their valuable time. < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Excessive no shows in relation to the number of events attended.Note that we take attendance at most events except music in the park events.Members are responsible to monitor their own registration status.When you are on a waiting list,
  don 't assume that you didn'
  tget in to an event. < br > < /p> <
      p > •Repeatedly bailing out of events right before they start.A high frequency of this behavior can lead to be removed from the group. < br > < /p> <
      p > • & nbsp;Stalking other members. < /p> <
  p > •Blocking the main organizer from contacting you. < br > < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;Showing up to & nbsp;an event without securing & nbsp;a spot(crashing).Note that members are not allowed to bring a guest to an event unless they secure a spot online
  for their guest. < /p> <
  p > • & nbsp;The same thing holds true
  for couples who use one profile.Make sure you secure two spots & nbsp;initially & nbsp;
  if both of you are attending an event.Note that
  if an event becomes full,
  you cannot add guests without losing your attending spot and being moved to the waiting list.Note that
  for some events with limited spots we don 't allow any guests&nbsp;to&nbsp;register as we want to provide value to as many members as possible.</p> <
  p > < strong > < br > < /strong></p >
  <
  p > < strong > Expected Member Conduct < /strong></p >
  <
  p > Members are expected to read the event description and any updates posted by the Event Organizer before attending an event.This helps eliminate the need to ask questions that have already been explicitly stated in the event description.It also keeps expectations in alignment with the event format / structure. < /p> <
  p > Please use a personal photo where you are recognizable
  for your profile as we like to know whom we are communicating with and we take attendance at our events.Otherwise you will not be admitted to the group or you might be removed from the group. < /p> <
  p > In order to receive important emails sent from Event Organizers,
  make sure that you have the following setting options enabled
  for this group: ‘Announcement about a specific Meetup’ and‘ Announcement to members about the group’. < /p> <
      p > Note that we sometimes remove inactive members from the group.We encourage active membership. < /p> <
      p > < strong > < br > < /strong></p >

Classes we've offered have been in music and dance, martial arts and yoga, meditation and philosophy, dating and relationships, acting and improvisation, networking and social media, foreign languages, computer use, job hunting, startups - and many other topics as well.

The SF Free School is focused on sharing activities and teaching skills which are fun,
healthy and useful. < strong > We are currently only listing classes that are located in the SF area. < /strong> Our events are often styled as potlucks, classes, workshops and public talks. We go on field trips, so we can explore new areas and discover new things, and we like to gather in parks and public areas. Indoors we gather in community centers and community meeting rooms, or we might be found in cafes, private homes and in public classrooms.< strong > All classes and events at our locations are free of charge and open to all. < /strong> We do not ask for cash for any of our classes and events and everyone is always welcome to attend our classes and events free of charge. Though our instructors and event hosts can accept donations which are freely offered for the classes and events they hold with us <strong>they may never ask for cash or donations from anyone who attends the classes and events they make available through the SF Free School.</strong > We only have one rule at the Free School: < strong > Be Excellent to Each Other < /strong> – and that is the only payment we ever require.</span > So come and enjoy yourself,
start training your body and your mind,
meet new people - or teach and share what you know.You are always welcome. ",

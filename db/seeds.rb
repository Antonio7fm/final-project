"description": "<p>We are a social group of singles and couples, including all ages of adults who enjoy exploring the wonderful Bay Area of Northern California. In fact, according to the Meetup.com algorithm, we are the most active "Social" group in the Bay Area. You are welcome to join us as we explore cool bars, night clubs, restaurants, museums, vineyards, hiking adventures, house parties, etc. We will also sprinkle in some community volunteer opportunities. We will&nbsp;<b>LEVERAGE</b> our group to receive discounts, extended happy hours, and other great perks that an individual cannot get. </p>
<p>***In order to join, you need to be recognizable in your photo. Having an action shot, group photo, or any photo&nbsp;where&nbsp;it's not clear who you are&nbsp;won't work as we take attendance at our events.</p>
<p>Our members range in age from 21 to 80+. We don't discriminate. If you are looking to just hang out with people your own age in trying to hook up, then this isn't the right group for you as this is a very diverse group with a lot of positive energy. Join and you will meet some quality, new friends. <br></p>
<p>This group is about helping out in the community, having fun, exploring the Bay Area, and meeting new friends while in a safe environment. By joining this group or&nbsp;remaining a member of this group, you agree to&nbsp;refrain from the&nbsp;list of inappropriate&nbsp;behaviors listed&nbsp; below while attending&nbsp;Explore the Bay&nbsp;events or&nbsp;visiting the Explore the Bay Meetup site. If you exhibit any of the following, you will be removed from the group:</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>•&nbsp;Sending spam emails to members to promote a business, event, etc. without permission of the main organizer. <br></p>
<p>• Posting comments on an event page or using the "Start a conversation..." functionality to promote a business, event, etc. without permission of the main organizer. <br></p>
<p>• Not having a picture where you are recognizable. If you aren't recognizable in your ETB profile picture, then you are subject to removal and will have to request to rejoin the group with a valid photo. <br></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Sending emails to members&nbsp;you haven't met for the purposes of dating or picking up. This isn't a dating website.</p>
<p>• Having multiple profiles with the group. Only one profile is permitted per person.</p>
<p>• Excessive posting of comments or negative comments on event wall-space. This requires the Event Host to volunteer additional time and also causes members to waste time looking for important event updates. Note that there is no need to tell us that you won't be attending an event. Merely change you your registration status. <br></p>
<p>• Texting or calling the Organizer for any reason other than trying to find the group during a meetup event. Note that the number is provided to facilitate finding the group only. No exceptions. <br></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Being&nbsp;touchy or physical with&nbsp;another member (overly aggressive). </p>
<p>•&nbsp;Causing&nbsp;another member&nbsp;to feel uncomfortable based upon behavior OR comments (creepiness).</p>
<p>• Showing&nbsp;inappropriate pictures or&nbsp;content&nbsp;to other members at an event.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Excessive gossiping about fellow members and/or creating too much drama. </p>
<p>• Behaving in a manner that suggests a sense of entitlement such as requesting organizers to volunteer too much of their valuable time.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Excessive no shows in relation to the number of events attended. Note that we take attendance at most events except music in the park events. Members are responsible to monitor their own registration status. When you are on a waiting list, don't assume that you didn't get in to an event. <br></p>
<p>• Repeatedly bailing out of events right before they start. A high frequency of this behavior can lead to be removed from the group. <br></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Stalking other members.</p>
<p>• Blocking the main organizer from contacting you. <br></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Showing up to&nbsp;an event without securing&nbsp;a spot (crashing). Note that members are not allowed to bring a guest to an event unless they secure a spot online for their guest. </p>
<p>•&nbsp;The same thing holds true for couples who use one profile. Make sure you secure two spots&nbsp;initially&nbsp;if both of you are attending an event. Note that if an event becomes full, you cannot add guests without losing your "attending" spot and being moved to the "waiting list". Note that for some events with limited spots we don't allow any guests&nbsp;to&nbsp;register as we want to provide value to as many members as possible.</p>
<p><strong> <br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Expected Member Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Members are expected to read the event description and any updates posted by the Event Organizer before attending an event. This helps eliminate the need to ask questions that have already been explicitly stated in the event description. It also keeps expectations in alignment with the event format/structure.</p>
<p>Please use a personal photo where you are recognizable for your profile as we like to know whom we are communicating with and we take attendance at our events. Otherwise you will not be admitted to the group or you might be removed from the group.</p>
<p>In order to receive important emails sent from Event Organizers, make sure that you have the following setting options enabled for this group: ‘Announcement about a specific Meetup’ and ‘Announcement to members about the group’. </p>
<p>Note that we sometimes remove inactive members from the group. We encourage active membership. </p>
<p><strong> <br></strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT TO READ REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS <br></strong></p>

<p>I agree to indemnify and defend ETB against all claims, causes of action, damages, judgements, costs or expenses, including attorney fees and other litigation costs, which may in way arise from my or my guest’s attendance of an ETB event.</p>
<p>I agree to pay for all damages to the facilities caused by any negligent, reckless, or willful actions by me or my guests.</p>
<p>Any legal or equitable claim that may arise from participation in the above shall be resolved under California law.</p>
<p>I agree and acknowledge that I am under no pressure or duress to agree to this and that I have been given a reasonable opportunity to review it before agreeing. I further agree and acknowledge that I am free to have my own legal counsel review this Agreement if I so desire.</p>
<p><b>I HAVE READ THIS DOCUMENT AND UNDERSTAND IT. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT BY JOINING THIS GROUP OR REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE GROUP, I VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER THESE CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS NOTED ABOVE.</b></p>",

"description": "<p>SF Python is your opportunity to grow your technical career by learning and sharing what you know with other local Python developers! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Organized by a handful of volunteers with the help of some faithful sponsors and your generous donations, we host: <br></p>
<p><a href="http://sfpythonmeetup.com/">2 monthly meetups</a></p>
<p>- Presentation Night on the 2nd Wednesday of each month features intermediate to advanced level tech talks from Python Software Foundation members, core developers of open-source projects, and local software engineers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Project Night on the&nbsp;3rd Wednesday of most months offers&nbsp;a&nbsp;chill evening to&nbsp;hack on projects, get questions answered, mentor other devs, or attend a&nbsp;tutorial. &nbsp;It's usually held at various companies in SF so you get to&nbsp;sample how different companies are using Python.</p>
<p><a href="http://pybay.com/">PyBay, a yearly regional Python Conference</a></p>
<p>PyBay is the local version of PyCon. &nbsp;You can save on travel costs and still have an experience of the conference that serious python developers aspire to attend. &nbsp;PyBay&nbsp;is a 3-day weekend conference in August featuring 40 talks and 400+ attendees.</p>
<p><a class="embedded" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMUUiioi5g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMUUiioi5g</a></p>
<p><a href="http://bayareapython.com/">An annual holiday party</a></p>
<p>We think you'd agree that if you have been coming to SF Python's events, you have been advancing in your field. &nbsp;So come celebrate the year with us. &nbsp;We will listen to more amazing speakers while enjoying great food and drinks. &nbsp;Who knows, if we continue to get lucky, we will have more amazing entertainers to help us celebrate the year.</p>
<p><b>Why do we put these events up?</b></p>
<p>We believe there is power in in-person interactions. &nbsp;We believe in learning, sharing, and helping each other out. &nbsp;And we have seen the results. &nbsp;We have heard stories of people getting their problems solved because of the talks and the people they met at our events. &nbsp;We have witnessed people grow in their career, from receiving their first internship to landing their first speaking gig at conferences. &nbsp;We have even heard companies migrating to a different platform/technologies after attending our conference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your joining this awesome community - be it attending our events, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/jOWUwI2R2ENvzCIr1">giving a talk</a>, being a sponsor or supporting us financially!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

<p> Interested in spending more time on the weekends in nature? Want to explore more of the Bay Area? Are you an afternoon person? Like to walk at a moderate pace? This may be the group for you! This Meetup is great for beginner or intermediate hikers. We will host a hike most Saturdays and Sundays. The hikes will average about five miles -- some shorter; some longer. Some of the hikes are dog-friendly. Most hikes will be in the Bay Area within 90 minutes of Palo Alto in Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey and Marin counties, although some will be farther away, e.g., Yosemite and Lake Tahoe.</p>

"description": "<p style="text-align : center"><span style="font-size : medium"><strong><span style="color : #272727"><span>Throughout the week the SF Free School offers free classes to anyone and everyone who wants to learn, have fun and meet new people. Classes we've offered have been in music and dance, martial arts and yoga, meditation and philosophy, dating and relationships, acting and improvisation, networking and social media, foreign languages, computer use, job hunting, startups - and many other topics as well.</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align : justify"><span style="color : #272727 ; font-size : medium">The SF Free School is focused on sharing activities and teaching skills which are fun, healthy and useful. <strong>We are currently only listing classes that are located in the SF area.</strong> Our events are often styled as potlucks, classes, workshops and public talks. We go on field trips, so we can explore new areas and discover new things, and we like to gather in parks and public areas. Indoors we gather in community centers and community meeting rooms, or we might be found in cafes, private homes and in public classrooms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align : justify"><span style="color : #272727 ; font-size : medium"><strong>All classes and events at our locations are free of charge and open to all.</strong> We do not ask for cash for any of our classes and events and everyone is always welcome to attend our classes and events free of charge. Though our instructors and event hosts can accept donations which are freely offered for the classes and events they hold with us <strong>they may never ask for cash or donations from anyone who attends the classes and events they make available through the SF Free School.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align : justify"><span style="color : #272727 ; font-size : medium">We only have one rule at the Free School: <strong>Be Excellent to Each Other</strong> – and that is the only payment we ever require.</span></p>
<p style="text-align : justify"><span style="color : #272727 ; font-size : medium">So come and enjoy yourself, start training your body and your mind, meet new people - or teach and share what you know. You are always welcome.</span></p>",

"description": "<p>We are a dynamic and fast growing Meetup group designed to build relationships and invest in Multi-Family projects together, and create massive cash flow, and wealth. We hold free monthly meetings in <b>San Francisco, San Mateo, Fremont</b> and <b>San Jose</b>, and <b>Online </b>(through webinars), so everyone is welcome to join.</p>
<p><b>WE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC: </b>In case you haven't noticed, the Multi-Family industry is benefiting from a once in a lifetime investor opportunity - The Millennial generation are less interested in buying homes than any previous generation, raising demand, stability and profit for Multifamily investors.</p>
<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/e/c/600_439752012.jpeg"></p>
<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/f/6/600_439752022.jpeg"></p>
<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/1/a/600_439752058.jpeg"></p>
<p><b>WE PROVIDE EDUCATION:&nbsp;</b>Our Meetup piggybacks on this mega-trend, and provides Multi-family education, networking and deal exposure to encourage investment in Multi-family properties in many states.&nbsp;<span>Whether you plan on setting up and running your own Multi-Family projects or want to invest passively in someone else's deal, this Meetup is the place to be.</span></p>
<p><b>WE PROVIDE ACCESS:&nbsp;</b><span>If you are lucky enough an accredited investor as defined by the SEC, you probably have access to some of these Multifamily projects.&nbsp;If you don't meet those qualifications, you can gain access to these awesome investment opportunities by getting educated and forging a relationship with deal organizers.</span></p>
<p><span>These are institutional type investments accessible only by grouping investment funds (unless you have very deep pockets). Multi-family is the investment of choice these days for all manner of institutional investors. Why? Because they are one of the most reliable and high-yielding investments out there.&nbsp; <br></span></p>
<p><b>THE RETURNS ARE EXCELLENT: </b>Multifamily investments returns typically outperform stock markets and single family investments. If you are still investing in CDs, Bonds or similar investments, take a look at the graphic below to see what an amazing difference higher return opportunities make to your quest for financial freedom.</p>
<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/0/3/600_439751011.jpeg"></p>
<p><b>WE KNOW A SECRET</b>: Don't tell anyone, but Multi-family investments create wealth almost magically. Unlike single family homes, Multi-family properties are primarily valued based on Net Operating Income. Even a tiny increase in Net Operating Income can create an enormous increase in net worth for the investors. Take a look at the typical example below. This isn't pie-in-the-sky math, it happens in Multi-family investing extremely regularly. <br></p>
<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/b/5/600_439750933.jpeg"></p>
<p><b>WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE: </b><span>It takes both training and experience to make it all come together and work.&nbsp;</span><span>With decades of collective experience, our organizer team has extensively training in multi-family and can guide you. Whether you are looking for great passive investments, support in buying your own property, or assistance putting your own projects together, we have the resources available within this group.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>We look forward to having you join us in this exciting, dynamic, profitable group! &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>JOIN US TODAY FOR FREE EDUCATION, NETWORKING AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.</b> <br> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sanfranciscobay/manage/settings/basic/"></a><span>Sierra Club San Francisco Bay Chapter</span> offers hikes and outdoor recreation for people of all ages. For a more complete listing of all Chapter outings and events see <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/activities">our calendar</a>. There are many more events on the calendar than it is possible to list on Meetup!</p>
<p>Outings are conducted by the San Francisco Bay Chapter's Activity Sections and Regional Groups. Activity Sections are organized around either an activity, such as hiking or backpacking, or a social theme, such as Sierra Singles. No matter the theme, our outings and activities are open to all. Everyone is welcome, including those who are not members of Sierra Club (unless, rarely, otherwise stated). For more information about the Chapter's activity sections, <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/activity-sections">click here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also join the Sierra Club, which is a good idea because it is the Sierra Club that makes all this possible. <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=DLjTBfJ8JvY&amp;offerid=343370.10000002&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">Join or renew today.</a> If you'd like to lead hikes or other outings, you'll need to be a member of the Club.</p>
<p>We also advocate for policies that protect our natural environment, support environmental candidates for public office, and provide opportunities for people who want to develop leadership skills to give back to the community and help the environment. We serve Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, and San Francisco Counties, California.</p>
<p><span>For additional information about our outings, including outing policies and rating codes (1A, 2B, etc.), please see <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/information-bay-chapter-outings#hikeratings">Hike Difficulty Codes</a></span>.</p>

"description": "<p>A meetup group to discuss the Go Programming Language.</p>
<p>(from golang.org)</p>
<p><span>The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.</span></p>",

"description": "<p>Different organizers schedule competitive but friendly events around the SF Bay Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>West Coast Soccer is not affiliated with a club or any other organization, we are soccer enthusiasts on the search of the next great game, <b>if you want to hold an event or host a game(s) please contact us!</b></p>
<p>No commitment is involved, the cost/contribution is always between 0- $20 per event - fees go towards equipment purchases/maintenance, organizer traveling expenses, Meetup dues, permits etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game time is at least 1 hour but might be more or less depending on venue/day/time, every session is supervised by an organizer and includes game balls, cones, goals, scrimmage vests for every player, and lots of playing time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's easy to join our soccer community and meet other footballers, just come by yourself or with friends, we form teams randomly as players show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join our Meetup group for free, it keeps you informed about upcoming sessions, allows you to communicate with other players and RSVP for games. After you registered you will automatically receive game invitations via email.</p>
<p>To play in any of our games RSVP for the game(s) you want to play in and show up 15 min early for a guaranteed spot, after that it becomes first come first serve!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game setup varies on different days, but we mostly play 7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, sometimes we rotate teams and allow subs depending on numbers. Most venues we utilize have an artificial turf surface, we recommend cleats, flats, or turf shoes, shin guards are not mandatory but recommended. Some games are with referees but most games are not.</p>
<p>Each game needs a min. of 12 RSVP'S in order to be viable or 8 players need to be present to play after 10min of the scheduled time. If a game is not viable after 10min of the scheduled time it will be canceled and everyone receives a full refund.</p>
<p>Happy Footballing!</p>",

"description": "<p>The Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup is a forum for developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts to learn about and develop for Ethereum. We have meetings on the technical details of the Ethereum protocol and contracts, and on more general subjects such as decentralized storage. We have meetings in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, and elsewhere in Silicon Valley; if you live in SF you may want to join our sister group: the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SF-Ethereum-Developers/">San Francisco Ethereum Developer Meetup</a>. <br></p>
<p>For more information on <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;see the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper">whitepaper</a>, the <a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf">yellowpaper</a>, forums on <a href="http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/">Stackexchange</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/ethereum">Reddit</a>, and also&nbsp;<a href="https://gitter.im/ethereum">Gitter Chat</a>.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>We welcome proposals for talks at svethereummeetup@gmail.com.&nbsp;<span>Here are a few things that we look at when evaluating projects that want to talk to us: (1)&nbsp;</span><span>Does your website, whitepaper, pitch look professional? (2)&nbsp;</span><span>How mature of an understanding of Ethereum and decentralization is shown? (3)&nbsp;</span><span>Is the business model something new, interesting, decentralized, and useful? &nbsp;(4) Are you willing to educate us (including the flaws and tradeoffs in your products), or are you solely interested in marketing</span><span>? We are very cautious about presentations from any group with a live token sale, or who are within two months of such a sale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our focus is on the good and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems">bad</a> of Ethereum; we prefer to leave the faults of other cryptocurrencies and organizations (the US dollar, Federal Reserve) to other venues wherever possible. &nbsp;</span><span>The Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup is dedicated to an enjoyable experience for all; see details </span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/pages/20918482/Anti-Harassment_Policy/">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Contact&nbsp;us at svethereummeetup@gmail.com if you'd like to help organize events.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>*** Enjoy Life in One of the World's&nbsp;Most Diverse, Cultural &amp; Quality&nbsp;</span>Cities !<span>&nbsp;***&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>GLOBAL FRIENDS -- There are no strangers here, just FRIENDS YOU HAVEN'T&nbsp;MET !&nbsp;</p>
<p>--- Message from Organizer: *We have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, racism, sexism, ageism, etc. - any insults towards members will result in ejection from the event. This group is meant to reflect the diversity of San Francisco, and to combine the many cultures within.&nbsp; <br> <br>Check your ego at the door, meet some new people at one of our events, and expand your professional and personal network in San Francisco. Most of all - have fun! ---- Paul</p>
<p>* A community is great because of its members, and we need you to make it great!&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>If you enjoy friendship, activities, music, arts,</i></p>
<p><i>networking, socializing, parties,</i></p>
<p><i>learning, sharing, inspiration, personal/professional development,</i></p>
<p><i>travel, culture, language, and/or some fun,&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>and&nbsp;you like them for free,</i></p>
<p><i>this is the group for you!!</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's explore together &amp; see what the city's got to offer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in an ever-shrinking world, where the technologies and transportation systems make it easier than ever to connect people from every corner of the world. We also have the fortune to live in a quality and vibrant city that is home to people of diverse backgrounds and life experience.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Friends Network</i>&nbsp;gives you an opportunity to experience some of the many international cultures that San Francisco hosts, to share your knowledge of cultural heritage, interests/hobbies&nbsp;or professional expertise with other members of the group, and make new friends while doing so.</p>
<p>A mission for this group is to provide good company as well as a positive and safe environment for members to experience things that, for whatever reasons, you longed for but weren't able to do before.&nbsp;You'll also get to know things that you can do and enjoy in San Francisco through the meetups proposed by your peers.&nbsp;It is also a hope of our group to promote cross-cultural dialogues, sharing, understanding, and peer&nbsp;supports&nbsp;through a variety of local activities and events, as well as international trips.</p>
<p>But we (organizers) are few and you are many, and this means that to work toward these goals we need the proactive participation and supports from at least some members of the community.&nbsp;This group is unique because of our members, and we look forward to meeting you and facilitate the meetup ideas you propose.</p>
<p>* We are a hundred thousand (100,000) global citizens&nbsp;that meet locally &amp; connect globally.</p>
<p>===========================</p>
<p>THE GLOBAL FRIENDSHIP NETWORK&nbsp;</p>
<p>===========================</p>
<p>A network where you get to meet new friends in every major city worldwide, a place people share their precious experience, perspectives, and cultures from every corner of the world!&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you happen to be traveling to the following cities or even thinking of the possibilities of staying somewhere overseas for a while (long or short), welcome to join the respective groups and connect to members there.&nbsp;We'll be happy to facilitate a welcoming/social meetup for you while you arrive (FREE of charge:), or contact our connections there for you in case you need assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our membership will ALWAYS be FREE&nbsp;for all groups in the network, as well as events and service from organizers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>* We are NOT associated/affiliated with any travel agencies, immigration companies, or other for-profit organizations etc. Just a service with good intentions &amp; best efforts:)</i></p>

Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley &amp; Alameda.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. <strong><span>99 out of every 100 doctors say "JOIN THIS GROUP!"</span></strong></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><strong><span>NEWS:&nbsp; We have a walk scheduled for Feb. 10th to be lead by Hugo. Howard will take roll and be in the back watching over slow walkers and late arrivals.</span></strong><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Our "group photo" was taken July 5th, 2015 at our walk "</span><span><span>The March to the Sea.</span><span>"</span></span></b></p>

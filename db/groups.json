    "description": "<p>We are a dynamic and fast growing Meetup group designed to build relationships and invest in Multi-Family projects together, and create massive cash flow, and wealth. We hold free monthly meetings in <b>San Francisco, San Mateo, Fremont</b> and <b>San Jose</b>, and <b>Online </b>(through webinars), so everyone is welcome to join.</p> <
    p > < b > WE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC: < /b>In case you haven't noticed, the Multi-Family industry is benefiting from a once in a lifetime investor opportunity - The Millennial generation are less interested in buying homes than any previous generation, raising demand, stability and profit for Multifamily investors.</p >

    p > < b > WE PROVIDE EDUCATION: & nbsp; < /b>Our Meetup piggybacks on this mega-trend, and provides Multi-family education, networking and deal exposure to encourage investment in Multi-family properties in many states.&nbsp;<span>Whether you plan on setting up and running your own Multi-Family projects or want to invest passively in someone else's deal, this Meetup is the place to be.</span > < /p> <
    p > < b > WE PROVIDE ACCESS: & nbsp; < /b><span>If you are lucky enough an accredited investor as defined by the SEC, you probably have access to some of these Multifamily projects.&nbsp;If you don't meet those qualifications, you can gain access to these awesome investment opportunities by getting educated and forging a relationship with deal organizers.</span > < /p> <
    p > < span > These are institutional type investments accessible only by grouping investment funds(unless you have very deep pockets).Multi - family is the investment of choice these days
    for all manner of institutional investors.Why ? Because they are one of the most reliable and high - yielding investments out there. & nbsp; < br > < /span></p >
    <
    p > < b > THE RETURNS ARE EXCELLENT : < /b>Multifamily investments returns typically outperform stock markets and single family investments. If you are still investing in CDs, Bonds or similar investments, take a look at the graphic below to see what an amazing difference higher return opportunities make to your quest for financial freedom.</p >
        <
        p > < img src = "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/0/3/600_439751011.jpeg" > < /p> <
    p > < b > WE KNOW A SECRET < /b>: Don't tell anyone, but Multi-family investments create wealth almost magically. Unlike single family homes, Multi-family properties are primarily valued based on Net Operating Income. Even a tiny increase in Net Operating Income can create an enormous increase in net worth for the investors. Take a look at the typical example below. This isn't pie-in-the-sky math, it happens in Multi-family investing extremely regularly. <br></p >

    p > < b > WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE: < /b><span>It takes both training and experience to make it all come together and work.&nbsp;</span > < span > With decades of collective experience,
    our organizer team has extensively training in multi - family and can guide you.Whether you are looking
    for great passive investments,
    support in buying your own property,
    or assistance putting your own projects together,
    we have the resources available within this group. & nbsp; < /span> <br></p >

    the cost / contribution is always between 0 - $20 per event - fees go towards equipment purchases / maintenance,
    organizer traveling expenses,
    Meetup dues,
    permits etc. & nbsp; < /p> <
    p > Game time is at least 1 hour but might be more or less depending on venue / day / time,
    every session is supervised by an organizer and includes game balls,
    cones,
    goals,
    scrimmage vests
    for every player,
    and lots of playing time. & nbsp; < /p> <
    p > It 's easy to join our soccer community and meet other footballers, just come by yourself or with friends, we form teams randomly as players show up.&nbsp;</p> <
    p > Join our Meetup group

    it keeps you informed about upcoming sessions,
    allows you to communicate with other players and RSVP

    p > To play in any of our games RSVP
    for the game(s) you want to play in and show up 15 min early
    for a guaranteed spot,
    after that it becomes first come first serve! & nbsp; < /p> <
    p > The game setup varies on different days,
    but we mostly play 7 v7,
    8 v8,
    or 9 v9,
    sometimes we rotate teams and allow subs depending on numbers.Most venues we utilize have an artificial turf surface,
    we recommend cleats,
    flats,
    or turf shoes,
    shin guards are not mandatory but recommended.Some games are with referees but most games are not. < /p> <
    p > Each game needs a min.of 12 RSVP 'S in order to be viable or 8 players need to be present to play after 10min of the scheduled time. If a game is not viable after 10min of the scheduled time it will be canceled and everyone receives a full refund.</p> <

    "description": "<p>The Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup is a forum for developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts to learn about and develop for Ethereum. We have meetings on the technical details of the Ethereum protocol and contracts, and on more general subjects such as decentralized storage. We have meetings in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, and elsewhere in Silicon Valley; if you live in SF you may want to join our sister group: the <a href="
    https: //www.meetup.com/SF-Ethereum-Developers/">San Francisco Ethereum Developer Meetup</a>. <br></p>
        <
        p > For more information on < a href = "https://www.ethereum.org/" > Ethereum < /a>&nbsp;see the&nbsp;<a href="https:/ / github.com / ethereum / wiki / wiki / White - Paper ">whitepaper</a>, the <a href="
    https: //ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf">yellowpaper</a>, forums on <a href="http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/">Stackexchange</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/ethereum">Reddit</a>, and also&nbsp;<a href="https://gitter.im/ethereum">Gitter Chat</a>.&nbsp; <br></p>
        <
        p > We welcome proposals
    for talks at svethereummeetup @gmail.com. & nbsp; < span > Here are a few things that we look at when evaluating projects that want to talk to us: (1) & nbsp; < /span><span>Does your website, whitepaper, pitch look professional? (2)&nbsp;</span > < span > How mature of an understanding of Ethereum and decentralization is shown ? (3) & nbsp; < /span><span>Is the business model something new, interesting, decentralized, and useful? &nbsp;(4) Are you willing to educate us (including the flaws and tradeoffs in your products), or are you solely interested in marketing</span > < span > ? We are very cautious about presentations from any group with a live token sale,
    or who are within two months of such a sale. & nbsp; < /span></p >
    <
    p > < span > Our focus is on the good and < a href = "https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems" > bad < /a> of Ethereum; we prefer to leave the faults of other cryptocurrencies and organizations (the US dollar, Federal Reserve) to other venues wherever possible. &nbsp;</span > < span > The Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup is dedicated to an enjoyable experience
    for all;see details < /span><a href="https:/ / www.meetup.com / EthereumSiliconValley / pages / 20918482 / Anti - Harassment_Policy / ">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Contact&nbsp;us at svethereummeetup@gmail.com if you'd like to help organize events.&nbsp;</span></p> <
